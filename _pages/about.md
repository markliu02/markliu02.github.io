I am currently an associate professor (not tenured yet) at the [Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures](https://www.dfll.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm) of Tsinghua University.  Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D in the [Rutgers Department of Linguistics](https://ling.rutgers.edu), and briefly worked at Hunan University. 

My research focuses on the  semantics of natural language, and its interface with pragmatics and syntax, from a cross-linguistic perspective. The phenomena I have worked on include focus particles (*only, even, also*), quantification (universal quantification, *wh*-quantification), conditionals and exceptives. 

At Tsinghua I teach courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels in formal semantics and  pragmatics. I also teach a seminar in each Spring semester that focuses on a specific topic in Mandarin grammar.

I collaborate with my colleagues from the  philosophy department, and we have been organizing [TLLM](http://tsinghualogic.net/JRC/tllm/) (Tsinghua Interdisciplinary Workshop on Logic, Language, and Meaning) since 2019.
